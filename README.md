# OPENAI_CHATGPT_API
Use ChatGpt to generate a list of original captions for a social media account, based on your given prompt.

Note: You must have a valid and funded OpenAI account to use their API. As long as you do, you can run this program as many times as you want.

Pro tip: add into your prompt something like "in a table format with columns 'id' and 'caption', generate 50 unique captions based on the following guidelines: ##INSERT YOUR GUIDELINES HERE. Then you can edit this program to pull captions in a specific order, without having to trigger ChatGPT for every single post.
